# Impractical Python Projects

This repository will contain the code I write while going through the *Impractical Python Projects* book. The code is organized according to the chapters of the book 
and the names of the projects in it.  

The goal of the code in this repository is not to build anything usefull, just to have fun and code. It is meant to be the code I write when I want to code
but don't have any idea what to build; just open the book and start coding.
